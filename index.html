        <h1>VR and Healthcare</h1>
        <h3>We can show you another reality</h3>
        <p>There are countless ways for VR to improve and deliver possibilities for healthcare.
          With VR, healthcare services, such as hospitals and clinics, will be able to train students and doctors with gamesolutions designed by our team. Our team works in close collaboration with you to achieve the exact desired product. </p>
          <p>-VR for training students and doctors</p>
          <p>-VR as therapy for patients suffering from anxiety, phobias and more</p>
          <p>-VR for healing patients with entertainment</p>
          <br>

        <h2>Working Together</h2>
        <p>Our passion for development is our drive to create game solutions with virtual reality. We create new ways of learning through a beautiful visual design because we love it.</p>
        <p>Virtual reality gives immersive opportunities for enjoyment, learning and much more. Stunning visuals and close work with our clients is our main priority. We want to create gamesolutions that can change the way we learn and develop as people.</p>
        <p>Hospitals in Denmark uses VR for education to qualify the students for operations. In an article by Lise Højer, Nora Hedbäck, who was one of the first students to try operating in virtual reality says <i>"It gives a lot, for example, the sense of how to move the instruments around. And then it's getting faster to get on patients, she says".</i><a href="https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/regionale/hovedstadsomraadet/hospitalet-som-computerspil-goer-laeger-bedre-til-operere" target="_blank" id="article-link">(Read the article <i>here.</i>)</a></p>
